# ArXiv Paper Search and Analysis System

## Overview
This system provides an intelligent research assistant that can search academic papers on arXiv, analyze them, and generate informed responses to user queries.

## Key Features

### 1. Smart Keyword Extraction
- Automatically extracts relevant keywords from user queries
- Optimizes search terms for the arXiv API
- Ensures more accurate paper retrieval

### 2. Vector Search Integration
- Uses Google's Generative AI for creating embeddings
- Stores paper vectors in Pinecone for efficient similarity search
- Enables semantic search beyond simple keyword matching

### 3. Intelligent Answer Generation
- Synthesizes information from multiple papers
- Provides context-aware responses
- Handles cases where no papers are found with graceful fallbacks
